These are offered free and as is; they may or may not work with any given version of Blender. I know for sure they work with 3.6.13 LTS, and I've tested most of them with 4.1, where they also work. Anything beyond that is untested (and won't be, I offer these for free instead of offering support). You're welcome to modify them to work as needed. 

TapTapSwap isn't solely mine, I've made changes to the original (https://github.com/Pullusb/TapTapSwap)

ShotDial, my (arguably) most useful addon, is a unique repository- find it here: (https://github.com/josephclaytonhansen/blender-shotdial)
