## Shading Rig + Cel Character Tools
More information coming soon.

Studio or professional users **must** purchase seat licenses of Shading Rig + Cel Character Tools. Licensing terms below.

## Other Addons
### audio-2-face-weight-import
Used with NVIDIA Audio2Face; adds a A2F JSON file as a NLA track (or animation layer) in Blender.

### cloth-sim-on-2s
Interpolates a baked (on-disk cache) cloth sim to be animated on twos

### delete-object-with-children
As written, replaces the default deletion behavior, instead deleting the children of a parent when deleting the parent. I don't use it, but apparently it's a Maya thing, made it for a co-worker

### multikey
Allows for adjusting and animating same-named shapekeys on multiple objects at once; for example, to make a "blink" key that uses Head, Eyebrows, and Eyelashes objects.

### qcb
Makes corrective blendshapes based on the angle or distance between two bone transform values- essentially a quick and dirty RBF node setup

### rendernotify
Plays a sound of your choosing when a rendering is complete

### searchable-vertex-groups
Allows to filter and select vertex groups by name; an incredibly useful function that should be built in

### select-by-uvmap
Select objects by UV map name

### silhouette-view
Adds a silhouette toggle to the shading header

### transfer-shape-keys
Transfers shape keys between objects of identical topologies 

## Notes
### General Usage Terms
Aside from Shading Rig + Cel Character Tools, these are offered free and as is; they may or may not work with any given version of Blender. I build and test on Blender 4.1 where they work. Anything beyond that is untested (and won't be, I offer these for free instead of offering support). You're welcome to modify them to work as needed. 

I take no liability for any effect these addons may have on your work in Blender, your installation of Blender, or your hardware running Blender. You use these addons at your own discretion and risk.

### Shading Rig + Cel Character Tools Usage Terms

Any individual, team, company, or other entity bringing in more than $99,000 USD in gross revenue annually, as payment, gratuity, or compensation for work done in Blender, wholly or in part, is a professional user and must purchase seat licensing. You accept these terms when you download Shading Rig + Cel Character Tools. Unlicensed professional usage (based on the previous conditions) is prohibited. 

I take no liability for any effect these addons may have on your work in Blender, your installation of Blender, or your hardware running Blender. You use these addons at your own discretion and risk.

####  Definitions
1. "Annually" is understood to mean the last 12 months up to the current day when Shading Rig + Cel Character Tools is used.
2. "Gross revenue" is understood to mean revenue before any deductions, including but not limited to: payroll, overhead, taxes, or other licensing fees.

* TapTapSwap isn't solely mine, I've made changes to the original (https://github.com/Pullusb/TapTapSwap)
* ShotDial, my (arguably) most useful addon, is a unique repository- find it here: (https://github.com/josephclaytonhansen/blender-shotdial)
