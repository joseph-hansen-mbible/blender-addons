These are offered free and as is; they may or may not work with any given version of Blender. I know for sure they work with 3.6.13 LTS, and I've tested most of them with 4.1, where they also work. Anything beyond that is untested (and won't be, I offer these for free instead of offering support). You're welcome to modify them to work as needed. 

TapTapSwap isn't solely mine, I've made changes to the original (https://github.com/Pullusb/TapTapSwap)

ShotDial, my (arguably) most useful addon, is a unique repository- find it here: (https://github.com/josephclaytonhansen/blender-shotdial)

## Addons
### audio-2-face-weight-import
Used with NVIDIA Audio2Face; adds a A2F JSON file as a NLA track (or animation layer) in Blender.

### cloth-sim-on-2s
Interpolates a baked (on-disk cache) cloth sim to be animated on twos

### delete-object-with-children
As written, replaces the default deletion behavior, instead deleting the children of a parent when deleting the parent. I don't use it, but apparently it's a Maya thing, made it for a co-worker

### multikey
Allows for adjusting and animating same-named shapekeys on multiple objects at once; for example, to make a "blink" key that uses Head, Eyebrows, and Eyelashes objects.

### qcb
Makes corrective blendshapes based on the angle or distance between two bone transform values- essentially a quick and dirty RBF node setup

### rendernotify
Plays a sound of your choosing when a rendering is complete

### searchable-vertex-groups
Allows to filter and select vertex groups by name; an incredibly useful function that should be built in

### select-by-uvmap
Select objects by UV map name

### silhouette-view
Adds a silhouette toggle to the shading header

### transfer-shape-keys
Transfers shape keys between objects of identical topologies
