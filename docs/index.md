## Cel Character Tools
Coming soon

## audio-2-face-weight-import
Used with NVIDIA Audio2Face; adds a A2F JSON file as a NLA track (or animation layer) in Blender.

## cloth-sim-on-2s
Interpolates a baked (on-disk cache) cloth sim to be animated on twos

## delete-object-with-children
As written, replaces the default deletion behavior, instead deleting the children of a parent when deleting the parent. I don't use it, but apparently it's a Maya thing, made it for a co-worker

## multikey
Allows for adjusting and animating same-named shapekeys on multiple objects at once; for example, to make a "blink" key that uses Head, Eyebrows, and Eyelashes objects.
## qcb
Makes corrective blendshapes based on the angle or distance between two bone transform values- essentially a quick and dirty RBF node setup

## rendernotify
Plays a sound of your choosing when a rendering is complete
## searchable-vertex-groups
Allows to filter and select vertex groups by name

## select-by-uvmap
Select objects by UV map name

## silhouette-view
Adds a silhouette toggle to the shading header

## transfer-shape-keys
Transfers shape keys between objects of identical topologies
