# Installing Shading Rig

Installing Shading Rig is very simple. Shading Rig does not have any external dependencies or add-on preferences, so you can just install your ZIP file as a regular Blender addon. Once this is done, you are ready to go!

You can find the Shading Rig in the NPR Category in your add-ons list if you need to disable it. ![NPR category](img/sr/shading-rig-in-addons-list.jpeg)
