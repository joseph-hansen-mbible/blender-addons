Turn off Read-Only Correspondences in the panel settings (which is on by default), select a correspondence, and you can change the values in the lowest panel. Renaming Correspondences Double-click a correspondence in the list to rename it. How do correspondences work? Earlier I said: If you have two correspondences, the Edit will move between the two positions as the light rotates between the two rotations. If you have more correspondences, the Edit will move between all of them as the light rotates through all of them. This is true, but it's a surface level explanation. Understanding how the edits move will help you better predict where they will be when the light is at a certain rotation. Info If you're not interested in the details, that's fine. All you need to know about correspondences is this: rotate the Light. Move and scale the Empty (Edit). Add a Correspondence. Do it again repeatedly. Click the - button to remove a correspondence. The Math and the Nitty-Gritty The basic idea is that given a list of light rotations -> empty positions and a current light rotation, we need to interpolate the empty position. This is a weighting problem, not dissimilar to how bones interact with vertex groups. It helps to think of this as two triangles. Given 3 correspondences, A, B, and C, there is a Light Rotation triangle with points A, B, and C, and an Empty Position triangle with points A, B, and C. (Because the light rotation is just a 3D vector, it can be mapped into space as a triangle just the same as the position.) Let us say the current light rotation is Point N, represented by this black dot: We can easily visually see where the correspondence is for Point N in the Empty position triangle. As N is nearly halfway between A and B, and point N is nearly at B and far from C, the Empty point N should also be nearly halfway between A and B, and nearly at B and far from C. The above triangles are identical. What if they're not? We can still visually interpolate the position of N in the Empty triangle with a similar process: What we're doing visually here is what's being done mathematically, just with normalized inverse distance weights and n-gons instead of triangles (truly, there's no visual elements involved at all.)","title":"Correspondences"},{"location":"shading-rig-correspondences/#editing-correspondences","text":"Once a correspondence is added, you can change the values manually if you want.

Each Edit can be customized to exactly what you need. Parameters You'll want to combine these parameters to create the effect you want, most effects require altering all of these parameters. Elongation Elongation changes the width to height ratio of the Edit. Note In the original paper, this is referred to as Anisotropy. However, it's not actually Anisotropy, and Elongation felt more accurate. Sharpness Sharpness \"puckers\" the horizontal corners of the Edit, or draws them as sharp corners. Info Positive Elongation combined with Sharpness creates a wide diamond shape. Amount Amount changes the way the Edit blends with other shading. An Amount of 1 means the Edit will have hard edges and move like a decal. A lower amount means the Edit will blend with the shading more, creating a smooth effect not unlike what you see with SDF modeling or metaballs. It's difficult to describe, so please compare and contrast what happens when this Edit is moved with an amount of .1, .3, and 1: For hard highlights or shadows, such as a \"eyelight\", Rembrandt triangle, or an under-nose shadow, you will want a higher value. For more generalized shading, a lower value will work better. Bulge Bulge thickens one end of the Edit, creating a pear-shaped effect. Note Bulge applies along a diagonal access. You can use Rotation to correct this. Bend Bend thickens the edit similar to Bulge, but it applies on the opposite diagonal axis. It's very difficult to explain Bulge and Bend, but they work well in combination to create a variety of effects. For example: Rotation Rotates the edit's effect. Edit Settings The first three fields are for the empty object, light object, and affected material. Empty Object Here you can change the empty object that the Edit uses. There's not generally a reason why you would do this, but you can. Light Object An Edit is tied to the rotation of one Light. If a specific light is not set, this field will automatically fill with the default light set in the Settings sub-panel. If you set a specific light, the Edit will instead respond to that light's rotation. Material An Edit affects one Material. This way, you can have multiple materials affected by Edits. Warning You probably should avoid changing this unless you have a specific reason to do so. The better workflow is to Set Up Shading Rig on Object , which will automatically set the material for you. However, if you need multiple edited materials per object, this will be useful. Note that if you change the material, you need to re-attach the Edit to the material. Click Add Edit to Material to do this. Display Type This sets the viewport display shape of the Edit's empty. Parent Object In order for an Edit to properly work on a character, it needs to track the character's rotation and position. I've provided the functionality to do this without breaking Correspondences here- just set the Parent Object to the character's object. Warning Please don't parent an Edit directly to something- it won't work and you will be sad. Use the Parent Object field to set up this relationship exclusively.

Edits are empties that you use to art-direct your shading. They are the building blocks of your shading rig. Correspondences define how Edits respond to lighting changes. A correspondence connects a Light rotation to an Edit position and scale. Panel Overview Shading Rig is designed to be easy to use. However, it is a complex addon. Taking a moment to familiarize yourself with the panel will help you get a better workflow. The panel is arranged in the order in which you generally do things- move from top to bottom as you work on your shading rig. Step 1: Set a Character Name In Section 1 , the Settings sub-panel, you can set a character name and a default light. The character name is used to identify the shading rig- you'll need to set this first. For this example, I'm going to name my character \"Sphere\". Once you set a character name, several things will happen- new buttons unlock in the panel, and you'll have an empty added to your scene called ShaderRigProperties_{character name} : Danger You must never, under any circumstances, delete this empty ShaderRigProperties_{character name} . You're welcome to hide it or move it, but it's an essential component for getting multiple Shader Rigs to work in tandem. If you want to set a default light, you can. You can set a light per edit, but if you want all the edits to use the same light, you can save a step by setting a default light here. You now have a button in Section 2 that says \"Append Required Nodes\" clickable. You should click it \ud83d\ude01 Step 2: Append Required Nodes You'll get a helpful notification: Appended 10 node groups and 1 material(s). \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffb Step 3: Set Up Your Scene You can use any mesh object as your character, but for this example, I'm going to use a simple sphere. I've also added a light and set it as default. Note There are two ways you can set up a shading rig on an object: let the shading rig handle the initial material setup, then add your nodes to the material. This is the recommended way, as it ensures that the shading rig is set up correctly. Or, add the shading rig to an existing material. For this example, I'm going to use option 1. You can learn more about option 2 in the Material Tricks section. Select the sphere and click the \"Set Up Shading Rig on Object\" button in the panel. This will create a new material for the sphere and set up the shading rig nodes. You'll get a notification; 'Sphere.001' set up with material 'ShadingRig_Base.001' . In rendered view, you'll see a simple cel shader on your object: In Section 3 , the Edits list, you have a + button. This adds a new edit: When you click this, an Edit will be added at the cursor location. This initial location doesn't matter much, you can move the Edit around freely. Step 4: Add an Edit Click it! A whole bunch of things will change in the panel, and you'll have a new empty added to the scene: This is a lot of stuff! Don't worry, we're going to skip past the vast majority of this for now. The only thing you need to do to start seeing results is click Add Edit to Material in Section 3 . Depending on your object, you may or may not see a change. If you don't, there are two things to check: 1. Make sure your edit is outside the object. If you haven't moved your 3D cursor, it might have placed the edit inside. Grab it and move it outside. 2. You probably need to scale the Edit up. The scale affects the size of the effect. Scale your Edit up until you see an effect. In my case, I had to scale the Edit up slightly to see it. Once you check both, you should see something like this: You can move the Edit around, and it will update the shading. You can also play around with the Edit settings. Note You can learn more about the settings in the Edit Settings section. For now, we're going to jump ahead to the next major part; Correspondences . Step 5: Add Correspondences In Section 4 , the Correspondences list, you have a + button. This adds a new correspondence. Before you click it, though, here's how correspondences work. When you click the + button, the current Light rotation and the current Edit position/scale are saved as a 1:1 pair. If you have two correspondences, the Edit will move between the two positions as the light rotates between the two rotations. If you have more correspondences, the Edit will move between all of them as the light rotates through all of them. This is much easier to demonstrate visually: That's all you need to know to get started.
