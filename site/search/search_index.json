Turn off Read-Only Correlations in the panel settings (which is on by default), select a correlation, and you can change the values in the lowest panel. Renaming Correlations Double-click a correlation in the list to rename it. Correlation Limits There is no limit to the number of correlations you can have per effect. That said, the higher the amount, the less smooth the interpolation will be. With two correlations, the Effect will move smoothly along a line between two points. With three, it will gracefully curve around a triangle. At numbers higher than 3, you run the risk of overlap, which will cause the Effect to jump around in unexpected ways. That is to say- if you visualize the Effect positions as points in space, vertices of an n-gon, the n-gon will either be manifold (no crossing/overlapping edges) or non-manifold: Info If this is hurting your head, don't worry about it. Just know that the higher the number of correlations, the higher the risk of the Effect jumping erratically. Generally, I find that 3-6 correlations works best. Your case may vary, but if your Effects are jumping around, consider using less correlations. How do correlations work? Earlier I said: If you have two correlations, the Effect will move between the two positions as the light rotates between the two rotations. If you have more correlations, the Effect will move between all of them as the light rotates through all of them. This is true, but it's a surface level explanation. Understanding how the effects move will help you better predict where they will be when the light is at a certain rotation. Info If you're not interested in the details, that's fine. All you need to know about correlations is this: rotate the Light. Move and scale the Empty (Effect). Add a Correlation. Do it again repeatedly. Click the - button to remove a correlation. The Math and the Nitty-Gritty The basic idea is that given a list of light rotations -> empty positions and a current light rotation, we need to interpolate the empty position. This is a weighting problem, not dissimilar to how bones interact with vertex groups. It helps to think of this as two triangles. Given 3 correlations, A, B, and C, there is a Light Rotation triangle with points A, B, and C, and an Empty Position triangle with points A, B, and C. (Because the light rotation is just a 3D vector, it can be mapped into space as a triangle just the same as the position.) Let us say the current light rotation is Point N, represented by this black dot: We can easily visually see where the correlation is for Point N in the Empty position triangle. As N is nearly halfway between A and B, and point N is nearly at B and far from C, the Empty point N should also be nearly halfway between A and B, and nearly at B and far from C. The above triangles are identical. What if they're not? We can still visually interpolate the position of N in the Empty triangle with a similar process: What we're doing visually here is what's being done mathematically, just with normalized inverse distance weights and \"n-gons\" instead of \"triangles\" (truly, there's no visual elements involved at all.) Since we're also storing the scale, this is technically interpolating between a set of 3D vectors and a set of 4D vectors, but that's impossible to visualize.","title":"Correlations"},{"location":"shading-rig-correlations/#editing-correlations","text":"Once a correlation is added, you can change the values manually if you want.

Each Effect can be customized to exactly what you need. Parameters You'll want to combine these parameters to create the effect you want, most effects require altering many of these parameters. Elongation Elongation changes the width to height ratio of the Effect. Note In the original paper, this is referred to as Anisotropy. However, it's not actually Anisotropy, and Elongation felt more accurate. Sharpness Sharpness \"puckers\" the horizontal corners of the Effect, or draws them as sharp corners. Info Positive Elongation combined with Sharpness creates a diamond shape. Hardness Hardness changes the way the Effect blends with other shading. An Hardness of 1 means the Effect will have hard edges and move like a decal. A lower hardness means the Effect will blend with the shading more, creating a smooth effect not unlike what you see with SDF modeling or metaballs. It's difficult to describe, so please compare and contrast what happens when this Effect is moved with an hardness of .1, .3, and 1: For hard highlights or shadows, such as a \"eyelight\" (a highlight in the eyes), Rembrandt triangle, or an under-the-nose shadow, you will want a higher value. For more generalized shading, a lower value will work better. Bulge Bulge thickens one end of the Effect, creating a pear-shaped effect. Note Bulge applies along a diagonal axis. You can use Rotation to correct this. Bend Bend thickens the effect similar to Bulge, but it applies on the opposite diagonal axis. It's very difficult to explain Bulge and Bend, but they work well in combination to create a variety of effects. For example: Mode This changes how the Effect is combined with other shading. There are 5 modes: Lighten (Default) : The Effect is mixed in to the shading, adding to the lit area. See the Lighten equation here: Lighten Blend Mode (Wikipedia) Subtract : The Effect is subtracted from the shading, removing lit areas. Where the Effect is light, the shading will be darkened. Where the Effect is dark, there will be no effect. Multiply : The Effect is multiplied with the shading, darkening dark areas and not affecting light areas. Darken : Similar to Multiply, but the opposite of Lighten. See the Darken equation here: Darken Blend Mode (Wikipedia) Add : The Effect is added to the shading. Light areas will now be lightened greater than a 0-1 range. In practice, this brings in slightly more of the effect, especially along tight corners, than Lighten . This example mainly shows the difference between Lighten and Add : This next example shows the different modes when Hardness is set to full 1.0 strength: Info The correct mode for an Effect varies. For example, combining multiple Effects with Subtract or Add mode will generally give you an all black or all white result as values end up in some strange range like [-2,-1]. I recommend using Lighten and Multiply as your first choices, and experimenting with other modes as desired. Clamping When stacking multiple Effects, you will go outside of a normalized range of [0,1]. Clamping it constrains it to the [0,1] range. Clamping is turned on by default, since things behave more intuitively when it is turned on. You can toggle it per Effect with the Clamp checkbox. Effect Rotation The rotation of the empty has a major effect on the shape of the Effect. If you're struggling to get the shape you want, try rotating the empty. Note Effect rotation is tied to correspondence, so you can vary the shape based on light rotation. Presets To help quickly get a desired effect, I've added some presets you can use. Note that these likely won't match the images below, as they're dependent on the form of the object. You'll need to tweak them, but they may be helpful starting points. Bean Useful for \"pringling\". Bowl On a rounded form, gives a saucer or lens shaped curve with a flat top. Leaf A pointed oval. Worm A thin bent line with rounded corners. The thickness stays consistent, unlike the Crescent preset, which arcs out from the corners. Crescent A crescent with sharp corners- the subtraction of overlapping circles. Capsule Triangle This makes a triangle under some circumstances but not all. Tweak as needed. Parabola Not a true parabola, rather a triangle with curved corners. Butte A square extrusion that only works near diffuse lighting or another Effect. Expanded Effects While I've built in these parameters, you can easily add more with additional nodes in your shader tree. Before adding more nodes, make sure you've experimented to make sure you can't get what you need with existing parameters. Extra nodes won't be appended over from scene to scene- only the default parameters can be moved from scene to scene. You'd need to recreate the extra nodes in your other scene. Effect Settings The first three fields are for the empty object, light object, and affected material. Empty Object Here you can change the empty object that the Effect uses. There's not generally a reason why you would do this, but you can. Light Object An Effect is tied to the rotation of one Light. If a specific light is not set, this field will automatically fill with the default light set in the Settings sub-panel. If you set a specific light, the Effect will instead respond to that light's rotation. Note You don't technically have to add a light object- if you don't, your Effect will remain statically positioned and rotated, and you won't be able to add correspondences. I'm not sure why this would be useful, but there may be a use case I haven't considered. Regardless, I recommend adding a light object even if you want a static Effect, in case you change your mind later. Material An Effect affects one Material. This way, you can have multiple materials affected by Effects. Warning You probably should avoid changing this unless you have a specific reason to do so. The better workflow is to Set Up Shading Rig on Object , which will automatically set the material for you. However, if you need multiple effected materials per object, this will be useful. Note that if you change the material, you need to re-attach the Effect to the material. Click Add Effect to Material to do this. Display Type This sets the viewport display shape of the Effect's empty. This will not affect the shape of the empty in any way \u2014 it is just a way to help visually distinguish between different Effects. Parent Object In order for an Effect to properly work on a character, it needs to track the character's rotation and position. I've provided the functionality to do this without breaking Correlations here \u2014 just set the Parent Object to the character's object. Warning Please don't parent an Effect directly to something \u2014 it won't work and you will be sad. Use the Parent Object field to set up this relationship exclusively.

For this part of the docs, I'm going to use this bust, which already has a complex material with textures: My goal here is to integrate a shading rig on this bust without breaking the existing materials and show real production techniques. Note Due to the limitations of Blender, you can only have 8 edits per material. In this section, we'll go over how to get around this limitation. Adding a Shading Rig to an Existing Material When you have a complex material, you can still add a shading rig to it. You just have to add the neccesary nodes from the Shading Rig to your existing material. Click Set Up Shading Rig on Object like you normally would. When you Set Up Shading Rig on Object , you will have a new material slot added and a new material set to it: Your existing material(s) will be untouched. It is necessary to Set Up Shading Rig on Object , but you don't need to use this material. Let's get back to our existing material. Remove the slot and the material ShadingRigBase_00x . We're going to recreate the crucial elements of this material on our existing material. The Shadin Rig looks for ShadingRig_Entry and ShadingRig_Ramp nodes. ShadingRig_Entry is the diffuse, glossy, or otherwise pre-existing shading, converted to RGB. On your materials, this will likely mean renaming your Shader to RGB node to ShadingRig_Entry . Note that you must actually rename the node, not just change the label! In my case, I have a DiffuseToRGB shader group that outputs diffuse lighting as RGB, so I'm going to rename this node. You can change the name of a node in the Shader Editor sidebar: Info What if want to use Glossy or something other than Diffuse? If you want to use Glossy or something other than Diffuse, you can do that. You just need to make sure that the final node is named ShaderRig_Entry . Next, I'll add a color ramp before the final, hard (constant) color ramp and name it ShadingRig_Ramp . Now we have this: At this point, there should not be any nodes between ShaderRig_Entry and ShadingRig_Ramp . You are now ready to start using this material. Let's switch our Material in the Settings : And add an Effect: When we Add Effect to Material , we will have a shading rig that works with our existing material. I've added three edits as an example: To do this, put a Math node set to Add (with second input 0) between ShadingRigEffect_SR_Effect_Bust_003 and all of its outputs. It's much easier to do this if you add a reroute, as I've done. Then you can toggle clamping as desired. Compare clamping on: Versus clamping off: Isolating an Effect Sometimes, it can be difficult to pinpoint exactly where an Effect is, especially on a complex mesh. Here, I am using the Blender realistic female basemesh as an example. I have an Effect, but I'm not sure it's doing what I want: To preview just an Effect without everything else going on, find the ShadingRigEffect_SR_Effect_* node- in my case, ShadingRigEffect_SR_Effect_BlenderBasemesh_001 and Preview it by Ctrl + Shift + Left Click: I want to add some shading to the arm around the elbow. I'm going to do this with careful manipulation of the Effect, including scale, location, and rotation. To get the shader back how it should be, find your ramps and connect the final ramp back to the Material Output: Now my arm looks great, but the legs have undesired shading from the Effect. Effects affect the entire object, so you will generally need to split your object up into multiple materials. Here, I've separated the section I want this Effect to affect: I'm now going to modify both materials so they look identical. By giving my new material the required nodes, I can add Effects to this material as well. I'm going to copy four nodes from the other material: Compare: With: Note It may feel strange to consider breaking your object up into many materials that look and behave the same. However, this is the best way to work around the limitation of having only 8 Effects per material. With the simple two-material split I've done here, I can now have 16 total Effects for this object. So, for best results, split your object into major \"chunks\" by material (i.e. hair, head, shirt, pants, shoes, etc). I know this way is not ideal, but until Blender fixes this particular issue, this is the best way to work with the Shading Rig.","title":"Material Tricks"},{"location":"shading-rig-material-tricks/#adding-a-shading-rig-to-an-existing-material","text":"When you have a complex material, you can still add a shading rig to it.

Effects are empties that you use to art-direct your shading. They are the building blocks of your shading rig. Correlations define how Effects respond to lighting changes. A correlation connects a Light rotation to an Effect position and scale. Panel Overview Shading Rig is designed to be easy to use. However, it is a complex addon. Taking a moment to familiarize yourself with the panel will help you get a better workflow. The panel is arranged in the order in which you generally do things- move from top to bottom as you work on your shading rig. Step 1: Set a Character Name Let's start from scratch, with a blank file. In Section 1 , the Settings sub-panel, you can set a character name and a default light. The character name is used to identify the shading rig- you'll need to set this first. For this example, I'm going to name my character \"Sphere\". Once you set a character name, you can Append Required Nodes , and you'll have an empty added to your scene called ShadingRigProperties_{character name} : Danger You must never, under any circumstances, delete this empty ShadingRigProperties_{character name} . You're welcome to hide it or move it, but it's an essential component for getting multiple Shading Rigs to work in tandem. You can set a light per effect, but if you want all the effects to use the same light, you can save a step by setting a default light here. You now have a button in Section 2 that says \"Append Required Nodes\" clickable. Click it! \ud83d\ude01 Step 2: Append Required Nodes You'll get a helpful notification: Appended 4 node groups and 1 material(s). \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffb Step 3: Add an Object to Shade Now that we have everything ready to go, I'm going to add a UV sphere and a light. I now have the option to Set up Shading Rig on Object : Click it! Clicking this button adds a new material slot to your object and assigns a copy of the base material. This base material splits empty Effects and diffuse lighting into a hard shadow/lit area in black and white. For now, we're going to leave this material alone. You can learn more about modifiying this material or making Shading Rig work with your materials in the Material Tricks section. Step 4: Add Effects Now, you will see something like this (assuming you have a light source): In Section 3 , the Effects list, you can add a new Effect by clicking the + button. Effects are created at cursor location, so I'm going to click outside the sphere to make sure the Effect is outside the sphere. This will make it easier to find and move. Once you add an Effect, the panel will change: The Active Effect Settings control the parameters of your new Effect. We will go into detail about those in the Effect Settings section. For now, we want to actually see the effect on our sphere. Let's do that! Step 5: Add the Effect to the Material In the panel at the bottom of the Active Effect Settings , you'll see Select a set-up mesh object . For us, this is our sphere. Let's select it and see what happens: Shading Rig works best on roughly human-sized character, so if you're working on a correctly sized human, you probably won't see this.. Our sphere is a bit too big, so I'm going to scale it down until I see an Add Effect to Material button: Info Don't worry about the object scale- it will be automatically applied when you Add Effect to Material . Now, we see the button, but we can't click it. Hovering over the button tells us why \u2014 the empty needs to be closer to the object. The proximity of the empty to the object affects the size of the Effect. If it is too far away, the Effect will be too small to see. Let's move it closer, until we can click that button, which we will then click: Wow! The Effect! You can start playing around with the Effect immediately \u2014 it updates in realtime. You can move it around, rotate it, scale it, and change the parameters in the Active Effect Settings . Step 6: Add Correlations In Section 4 , the Correlations list, you have a + button. This adds a new correlation. Before you click it, though, here's how correlations work. When you click the + button, the current Light rotation and the current Effect position/scale are saved as a 1:1 pair. If you have two correlations, the Effect will move between the two positions as the light rotates between the two rotations. If you have more correlations, the Effect will move between all of them as the light rotates through all of them. This is much easier to demonstrate visually: Although it is not a driver-driven relationship, it does act like one. That's all you need to know to get started.

It doesn't provide magic buttons- rather, it adds tools that enhance existing Blender functionality. To work effectively with Shading Rig, you need to be comfortable navigating and using the shader editor. You also need to be familiar with material assignments, material slots, and custom properties. You don't need in-depth experience with any of this, but you need to understand the basics. If you are a beginner to Blender, you should hold off on using Shading Rig until you are more comfortable with Blender as a whole. If you have a problem not addressed below, I will help you solve it if you have a seat license. Otherwise, you will have to find an answer through trial and error or elsewhere in the docs. Why am I not seeing an effect? Reset Rotation The most common problem I've encountered as people test this is that the Effect isn't showing. In 99% of cases I've observed, the problem is with rotation of the empty controlling the Effect. The first thing you should when troubleshooting is reset the rotation of the Empty (you can do this with Alt + R): Here, my Effect was not showing up. I reset the rotation, and it shows up. Check Distance from Object If that doesn't do it, move the empty closer to your object. The distance from the object matters: Keep your effects close to your object for best results. Check Parameters Increase the Hardness. At lower values, the Effect may not always show up. Check Mode When in doubt, switch back to Mode 0, which will always show up. Did you change, disconnect, or rename something in the shader? Warning Don't! There are things you can play with in the shader and things you cannot . Anything between the two red \" Do not touch this! \" frames, you must not alter in any way! You can change, modify, rename, or do whatever with the \" You Can Touch This \" nodes. You cannot in any way alter the red \" Do not touch this! \" node after it. Don't look at it. Don't think about it. Expunge it entirely from your mind and memory. If you modify one of these forbidden nodes or any of the nodes in-between the two forbidden nodes, you will break everything permanently. The only way to fix this is to manually remove these nodes, delete the Effect, and recreate it. One last time, just for safety: don't touch anything between and including red \"Do Not Touch This!\" nodes!! I add another effect and suddenly everything turns white/black! You've moved your data to a range beyond what can be displayed. Change the mode of your effect, and try toggling clamping. Be especially careful with combining multiple Add and Subtract mode effects. If you Add to an Add , you have now moved your data from a [0,1] range to a [1,2] range. If you Subtract from a Subtract , your data is now in a [-1,0] range. In either case, you will see only white or only black. I add an effect and my material doesn't show any shading? Scale down your Effect. If the scale is too large, it will flood the whole object. I can't append the required nodes? Set a Character Name . I can't add a correspondence? Your Effect doesn't have a light set. Parameter X doesn't seem to do anything when I change it? Some values only show up when you scale or rotate the effect. Reset your rotation, then rotate. Play around. All the parameters do nothing? You've most likely broken the custom properties on your object. This happens from time to time if you aggressively undo or otherwise screw with your data. You can tell really easily, pull up the custom properties on your object: Adjust parameters: If the custom property changes, everything is fine. Reset your rotation and scale down your empty. If it doesn't change, you've broken something. The simplest fix is to simply remove the custom property, remove the effects, and redo. My Effect is jumping suddenly between correlations as I rotate the light? The reason for this behavior is explained in Correlations . Try removing some of your correlations and use less correlations. The more correlations, the more likely jumpiness is. I deleted the ShadingRigBase_00x material from my object, now I cannot get the Effects to show up! Make sure whatever material you are using has the two required nodes (see Material Tricks ). Note that it's the node name , not the node label that matters. It's easy to get tripped up by this, because the name isn't displayed in the Shader Editor. For example, this will work: This will not work: I get a popup error AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get' when I try to add/edit/remove an effect! Remember in the Quick Start when I said: Danger You must never, under any circumstances, delete this empty ShadingRigProperties_{character name} ? Well, this empty has been deleted. Yikes. Undo if you can. If that doesn't work- all you can do now to fix this is reset everything- remove any custom properties from any objects, delete all effects, effect materials, and export all objects into a new scene and new Blender file. Your current Blender file is permanently broken now. You can only move forward by resetting and moving your objects to a new file. I try and add a correlation but I get the popup error AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get' ? See the previous answer. Your Blender file is permanently broken. Reset into a new file. I try and do X but I get the popup error AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get' ? You deleted the undeletable empty. Your Blender file is permanently broken.
